<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a hard working, challenge driven person. My mind set drives me to be the best at what someone asks of me and I am always putting 110% into whatever task is handed to me.
I graduated from an academy in Denmark where the focus was on front end development and the process on how to start and grow a business as well as maintaining existing businesses. 
I have been self teaching for a deeper understanding in front end development since I graduated. </p>
